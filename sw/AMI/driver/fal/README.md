## Overview
The Firmware Interface (FW_IF) is an abstraction layer to any driver, providing a common API regardless of the physical interface.

The purpose of this layer is to allow user applications to be developed agnostic of the platform they are to be used on, and (as far as is possible) agnostic of the protocol they are using.

To an extent, this is OO (Object-Oriented), as it allows the user application to treat each interface as an object with public methods.


## Terminology

| Terminology            | Meaning                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interface              | An abstraction of a data flow device, E.g.<br><br>* a device driver<br>* a data layer on top of a driver (parser, protocol, etc.)              |
| Instance               | A C object that provides the API to control a specific port of a driver interface                                                              |
| Common header          | **fw_if.h** - the header file common to all interfaces and instances, agnostic to the protocol or the platform.                                |
| Common protocol header | **fw_if_XXX.h** (e.g. **fw_if_smbus.h**) - the header file specific to a protocol but common to all platform-implementations of that protocol. |



# File Structure

## Top level

The top level contains the public header file for the abstraction layer - **fw_if.h**. This provides the generic API common to all interfaces and protocols.

Any build configuration should be added here (in the example above, a CMakeList.txt file to configure CMake).


## Build

This is where the abstraction built is placed after a successful build. It is a static library (**libfw_if.a**).


## Protocols

Each protocol is in a separate directory (e.g. **smbus**, **i2c**, etc).

New protocols get a new directory.

There should never be any overlap or 'merging' of protocols - each should be separated.


### Common

Within each protocol is the common header file, named **fw_if_XXX.h**, where "XXX" is the protocol (e.g. **fw_if_smbus.h**). This is the public header file which is **specific to the protocol** but **agnostic to the platform**.

This file provides the API for the **init()** and **create()** functions of a protocol, and the protocol-specific configuration structures, enums, and events.

If a system was changing from one protocol to another, this is the only aspect they would have to change their references to.


### Implementation

Each protocol directory then has a subdirectory for each platform (e.g. **v70**, **v80**, **linux**, etc). Additional subdirectories can be used for adapter-specific implementations (e.g. **aardvark**), which should be treated the same as platforms.

Within each implementation directory is the source file for that platform and protocol (e.g. **fw_if_smbus_v70.c**). It should implement the generic API provided in **fw_if.h**, and the protocol-specific API provided in the common protocol  header file (in this example, **fw_if_smbus.h**).



# API

_**Note - the examples shown are from the SMBus implementation of the FW_IF.**_


## Standard definitions

```
#define FW_IF_TRUE                  ( 1 )
#define FW_IF_FALSE                 ( 0 )
```
Use in place of standard boolean definitions.

```
#define FW_IF_TIMEOUT_NO_WAIT       ( 0 )
#define FW_IF_TIMEOUT_WAIT_FOREVER  ( -1 )
```
Use for write/read operations if the requested timeout is a non-standard wait.


## Errors and return values

Function return values and errors are common to all protocols, so that a user application may be ported to another driver without requiring any change to return checks or logic.
```
/*
 * @enum    FW_IF_ERRORS
 * @brief   Return values from an fw_if function
 */
typedef enum _FW_IF_ERRORSy
{
	FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE = 0,				 /* no errors, call was successful */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_PARAMS,				 /* invalid parameters passed in to function */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_INVALID_HANDLE,		 /* invalid handle to the fw_if */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_INVALID_CFG,			 /* invalid config in the fw_if */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_UNRECOGNISED_OPTION,    /* invalid option passed in to ioctrl function */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_DRIVER_IN_USE,          /* driver was in use by another process */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALISED, /* driver was not initialised correctly */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_TIMEOUT,                /* a non-0 timeout value was requested and expired */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_BINDING,                /* the callback was not successfully bound in */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_OPEN,                   /* this should cause a driver-specific event to be raised to the bound callback */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_CLOSE,                  /* this should cause a driver-specific event to be raised to the bound callback */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_WRITE,                  /* this should cause a driver-specific event to be raised to the bound callback */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_READ,                   /* this should cause a driver-specific event to be raised to the bound callback */
	FW_IF_ERRORS_IOCTRL,                 /* this should cause a driver-specific event to be raised to the bound callback */

	MAX_FW_IF_ERROR,

} FW_IF_ERRORS;
```
This is not an exhaustive list - however, any additions must take into consideration that they must be available to all protocols.

All FW_IF functions must return the above values as a **uint32_t**.


## Initialising the driver

Driver initialisation must happen once before an interface instance can be created or used.

The driver initialisation is specific to the protocol - therefore, the initialisation function and the configuration structure are defined in the **common protocol header**.

Within each common protocol header is an "INIT_CONFIG" - a structure used during initialisation of the driver but not needed for individual instances of that interface.
```
/*
 * @struct  FW_IF_SMBUS_INIT_CFG
 * @brief   config options for smbus initialisation (generic across all smbus interfaces)
 */
typedef struct _FW_IF_SMBUS_INIT_CFG
{
	uint32_t        baseAddr;
    uint32_t        baudRate;

} FW_IF_SMBUS_INIT_CFG;
```
In this example, **baseAddr** and **baudRate** are configuration values that will be required for all implementions of an SMBus driver.

If any configuration values aren't required for a specific implementation, they can be ignored (e.g. the Linux implementation probably won't need a Base Address value).

```
/*
 * @brief   initialisation function for smbus interfaces (generic across all smbus interfaces)
 *
 * @param   cfg        pointer to the config to initialise the driver with
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS
 */
extern uint32_t FW_IF_smbus_init( FW_IF_SMBUS_INIT_CFG * cfg );
```
The initialisation function should only pass in a pointer to the initialisation structure, so that porting a user application from one driver to another takes minimal effort (only the structure contents and the name of the function need changed).

_**Note - the user application is responsible for the storage of the configuration structure.**_


## Creating an interface

This functionality requires that a driver has been initialised

As with the driver initialisation, interface creation is specific to the protocol and therefore the API is provided in the **common protocol header**.

Within a driver, there may be multiple _**instances**_ that can be created and used.

An instance can be thought of as a port or an address on a driver that can be used for a single stream of read/write data (it may be write-only or read-only in practice).

E.g. A single SMBus driver might allow up to 7 instances to be created on it - within the FW_IF, these can be handled as 7 individual and separate interfaces.

Each interface has public methods and private data, held in a config.

```
/*
 * @struct  FW_IF_CFG
 * @brief   Structure to hold a fw_if instance
 */
typedef struct _FW_IF_CFG
{
    uint32_t                upperFirewall;

    FW_IF_open          *   open;
    FW_IF_close         *   close;
    FW_IF_write         *   write;
    FW_IF_read          *   read;
    FW_IF_ioctrl        *   ioctrl;
    FW_IF_bindCallback  *   bindCallback;

    FW_IF_callback      *   raiseEvent;

    void                *   cfg;

    uint32_t                lowerFirewall;

} FW_IF_CFG;
```
_**Note - the user application is responsible for the storage of the interface structure.**_

The **cfg** parameter holds the private data that is passed in during the interface creation.


Within each common protocol header is an "CONFIG" - a structure used during interface creation and throughout any logic that the interface may use in its implementation.
```
/* additional enums, etc, specific to this interface */
#define FW_IF_SMBUS_UDID_LEN    ( 16 )

/*
 * @enum    FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE
 * @brief   Controller or Target
 */
typedef enum _FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE
{
    FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE_CONTROLLER = 0,
    FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE_TARGET,

    MAX_FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE

} FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE;

...

/*
 * @struct  FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG
 * @brief   config options for smbus interfaces (generic across all smbus interfaces)
 */
typedef struct _FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG
{
    uint32_t            port;
    FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE    role;
    uint8_t             udid[ FW_IF_SMBUS_UDID_LEN ];

} FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG;
```
In this example, **port**, **arpCapable** and **udid** are configuration values that each interface needs to know about itself.

**Note - _port_ is a generic term that can be thought of as simply the ID of an interface. It may be the address or simply an index. In the SMBus example, it would be a Target address**.

As before, if any values aren't required for a specific implementation, they can be ignored.

```
/*
 * @brief   creates an instance of the smbus interface
 *
 * @param   fwIf        fw_if handle to the interface instance
 * @param   smbusCfg    unique data of this instance (port, address, etc)
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS
 */
extern uint32_t FW_IF_smbus_create( FW_IF_CFG *fwIf, FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG *smbusCfg );
```
* The parameter ***fw_if** is the handle to the interface that will be used for all subsequent calls (e.g. **open**, **write**, etc). It must initialised in the user application as an empty structure.
* The parameter ***smbusCfg** is a pointer to the instance configuration structure shown previously - within the implementation, the contents will be copied to the private structure of the **fw_if** handle.

_**Note - the user application is responsible for the storage of the configuration structure.**_


## Opening / Closing an interface

This functionality is common to all protocols, and so is provided in the **common header**.

It requires that a driver has been initialised and an interface has been created on it.

Each implementation source file must provide a local (static) implementation of this function.

```
/*
 * @brief   Open the specific fw_if
 *
 * @param   fwIf        Pointer to this fw_if
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS
 */
typedef uint32_t ( FW_IF_open )( void *fwIf );
```

Within the SMBus example, this will create a target device with the values provided in the **device creation function**.

In another protocol, it may be as simple as setting a flag, or it may be more involved.

```
/*
 * @brief   Close the specific fw_if
 *
 * @param   fwIf        Pointer to this fw_if
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS
 */
typedef uint32_t ( FW_IF_close )( void *fwIf );
```

This must close the interface. Within the SMBus example, this will delete the previously created target device.


## Writing data from an interface

This functionality is common to all protocols, and so is provided in the **common header**.

It requires that a driver has been initialised and an interface has been created on it.

Once an interface has been opened, outgoing data (Tx) can be written from it.

```
/*
 * @brief   Writes data from an instance of the specific fw_if
 *
 * @param   fwIf        Pointer to this fw_if
 * @param   dstPort     Remote port to write to
 * @param   data        Data buffer to write
 * @param   size        Number of bytes in data buffer
 * @param   timeoutMs   Time (in ms) to wait for write to complete
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS
 */
typedef uint32_t ( FW_IF_write )( void *fwIf, uint32_t dstPort, uint8_t * data, uint32_t size, uint32_t timeoutMs );
```
For the **timeoutMs** parameter, the additional **#defines** may also be used:

* FW_IF_TIMEOUT_NO_WAIT - the function will return as soon as the write is attempted, regardless of any delay.
* FW_IF_TIMEOUT_WAIT_FOREVER - the function will not return until the write is successful or has failed.


## Reading data from an interface

This functionality is common to all protocols, and so is provided in the **common header**.

It requires that a driver has been initialised and an interface has been created on it.

Once an interface has been opened, incoming data (Rx) can be read from it.

```
/*
 * @brief   Reads data from an instance of the specific fw_if
 *
 * @param   fwIf        Pointer to this fw_if
 * @param   srcPort     Remote port to read from
 * @param   data        Data buffer to read
 * @param   size        Pointer to maximum number of bytes allowed in data buffer
 *                          This value is updated to the actual number of bytes read
 * @param   timeoutMs   Time (in ms) to wait for read to complete
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS */typedef uint32_t ( FW_IF_read )( void *fwIf, uint32_t srcPort, uint8_t * data, uint32_t * size, uint32_t timeoutMs );
```
For the **timeoutMs** parameter, the additional **#defines** may also be used:

* FW_IF_TIMEOUT_NO_WAIT - the function will return as soon as the write is attempted, regardless of any delay.
* FW_IF_TIMEOUT_WAIT_FOREVER - the function will not return until the write is successful or has failed.

This function is best called in an Rx task loop - if the user application does not want to use a task to pend on incoming data, and wants real-time data, it is advised to use the **callbacks** method instead.
However, if an implementation is designed to only use interrupt-based Rx'ing, it limits moving between alternative implementation as needed.

To determine if a FW_IF implementation provides polling and/or event-driven Rx data, see the **IO CTRL** "**FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_GET_RX_MODE**" option.


## Binding callbacks

This functionality is common to all protocols, and so is provided in the **common header**.

It requires that a driver has been initialised and an interface has been created on it.

The **common header** provides some generic events that are usable by all protocols:

```
/*
 * @enum    FW_IF_COMMON_EVENTS
 * @brief   common events raised in the callback (generic across all interfaces)
 */
typedef enum _FW_IF_COMMON_EVENTS
{
    FW_IF_COMMON_EVENT_NEW_RX_DATA,
    FW_IF_COMMON_EVENT_NEW_TX_COMPLETE,
    FW_IF_COMMON_EVENT_WARNING,
    FW_IF_COMMON_EVENT_ERROR,

    MAX_FW_IF_COMMON_EVENT

} FW_IF_COMMON_EVENTS;
```

Each protocol provides specific **events** - these are specific to the protocol and so are provided in the **common protocol header**. They must begin with the value of **MAX_FW_IF_COMMON_EVENT**.

```
/*
 * @enum    FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENTS
 * @brief   smbus events raised in the callback (generic across all smbus interface)
 */
typedef enum _FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENTS
{
    FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_ADDRESS_CHANGE = MAX_FW_IF_COMMON_EVENT,

    MAX_FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT

} FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENTS;
```
The maximum allowed value of an event is 0xFFFF.

Events are raised through a pre-defined callback.

```
/*
 * @brief   Callback to raise to calling layer
 *
 * @param   eventId     Unique ID to identify the event
 * @param   data        Pointer to data buffer
 * @param   size        Number of bytes in data
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS
 */
typedef uint32_t ( FW_IF_callback )( uint16_t eventId, uint8_t * data, uint32_t size );
```

If a user application wishes to receive real-time events from an interface, they must implement the above function.

A different function can be implemented per interface, or a common function can be used for all of them if the interface itself is not important (e.g. the application only cares about the data or the eventId itself).

* The **eventId** parameter must be one of the values defined in the previously shown event enum.


If a user application does not want to use a task to pend on incoming data, and wants real-time data, it can use the **NEW_RX_DATA** event to receive data whenever it is received by the underlying interface. For this to be possible, each implementation must call the **raiseEvent()** callback in the *******fw_if** handle upon receiving new data.

E.g. for the SMBus driver implementation, each target device created has its own callback that is triggered when new data is received. That callback would in turn call the **raiseEvent** callback associated with the interface instance of that target address, with the eventID set to **FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_NEW_RX_DATA**.

The above callback must be bound to interface instance before it can be triggered.

```
/*
 * @brief   Binds a user-defined callback into the fw_if
 *
 * @parmam  fwIf        Pointer too this fw_if
 * @param   newFunc     Function pointer to call
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS
 */
typedef uint32_t ( FW_IF_bindCallback )( void *fwIf, FW_IF_callback * newFunc );
```

A user does not need to bind a callback if they do not need one.


## IO Ctrl

This functionality is common to all protocols, and so is provided in the **common header**.

It requires that a driver has been initialised and an interface has been created on it.

There is some IO ctrl that is common to all protocols, and so is defined the **common header.**

```
/*
 *  @enum   FW_IF_RX_MODE
 *  @brief  Mode of Rx operation
 */
typedef enum _FW_IF_RX_MODE
{
    FW_IF_RX_MODE_POLLING   = 0x01,         /* driver must be polled for new data */
    FW_IF_RX_MODE_EVENT     = 0x02,         /* driver will raise an event to announce new data */

} FW_IF_RX_MODE;

/*
 * @enum    FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_OPTIONS
 * @brief   IO ctrl options common to all fw_ifs
 */
typedef enum _FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_OPTIONS
{
    FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_FLUSH_TX = 0,
    FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_FLUSH_RX,
    FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_GET_RX_MODE,

    MAX_FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_OPTION

} FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_OPTIONS;
```
* **FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_FLUSH_TX** : clears any data currently in the Tx buffer.
* **FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_FLUSH_RX** : clears any data currently in the Rx buffer.
* **FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_GET_RX_MODE**: returns the implementation's **FW_IF_RX_MODE** (polling, event-driven, or both) as a uint8_t with bit-flags.

Additional IO Ctrl options for a specific protocol can then be provided in the **common protocol header**.

```
/*
 * @enum    FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_OPTION
 * @brief   ioctrl options for smbus interfaces (generic across all smbus interfaces)
 */
typedef enum _FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_OPTIONS
{
    FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_SET_CONTROLLER = MAX_FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_OPTION,
    FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_SET_TARGET,

    MAX_FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_OPTION

} FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_OPTIONS;
```
Note that the first protocol-specific IO option must always be set to **MAX_FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_OPTION**.


The user application can then set an option (and pass an associated value, if necessary).

```
/*
 * @brief   Set/get specific IO options to/from the specific fw_if
 *
 * @param   fwIf        Pointer to this fw_if
 * @param   option      Unique IO Ctrl option to set/get
 * @param   value       Pointer to value to set/get
 *
 * @return  See FW_IF_ERRORS
 *
/typedef uint32_t ( FW_IF_ioctrl )( void *fwIf, uint32_t option, void * value );
```
* The parameter **option** must be an enum value from either the common list or the protocol specific list.
* The parameter **value** can be **NULL** if no value is required for the option. This parameter allows the user application to set or get data from an interface.
  * For the common IOCTRL options "FW_IF_COMMON_IOCTRL_GET_RX_MODE", this value will be a **uint8_t** with the appropriate **FW_IF_RX_MODE** flags set.



Note - to avoid losing the benefits of the firmware abstraction, the user application should keep IO Ctrl calls to a minimum.



# Examples

Unless otherwise stated, each example shown here uses the V70 SMBus driver implementation.


## Initialising the driver

This function should only be called once. Drivers should be developed to cater for this, either with an API that returns the initialisation status or by returning a recognisable return code if a user attempts to initialise the driver a 2nd time.

```
    FW_IF_SMBUS_INIT_CFG mySmbusIf =
    {
        0x12345678,    /* baseAddr */
        100000        /* baudRate */
	};

    if( FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE == FW_IF_smbus_init( &mySmbusIf ) )
    {
		printf( "SMBus initialised OK\r\n" );
	}
	else
    {
		printf( "Error initialising SMBus\r\n" );
	}
```

Within the **FW_IF_smbus_init()** function, the implementation:

1. Checks if the driver has not already been initialised.
2. Takes a local copy of the **FW_IF_SMBUS_INIT_CFG** structure (it only needs one local copy, so no dynamic memory allocation is required).
3. Calls the driver-specific initialisation function.


## Creating an interface instance

```
static FW_IF_CFG myIf = { 0 };        /* always initialised as empty */
static FW_IF_CFG *pIf = &myIf;        /* not necessary, but it's helpful to consider the FW_IF as a handle, not a struct */

static FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG cfg =
{
    0x56,                            /* port */
    FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE_CONTROLLER,    /* role */
    { 0x11, ... }                    /* udid */
};

...

	if( FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE == FW_IF_smbus_create( pIf, &cfg ) )
	{
		printf( "SMBus %02X created OK\r\n", cfg.port );
	}
	else
	{
		printf( "Error creating SMBus %02X\r\n", cfg.port );
	}
```

Within the **FW_IF_smbus_create()** function, the implementation:

1. Sanity checks the config.
2. Populates the variables within **FW_IF_CFG** parameter with the local implementation functions.
3. Copies the contents of the **FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG** to the private data area of the handle.

```
uint32_t FW_IF_smbus_create( FW_IF_CFG *fwIf, FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG *smbusCfg )
{
    uint32_t status = FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE;

    if( ( NULL != fwIf ) && ( NULL != smbusCfg ) )
    {
		if( MAX_FW_IF_SMBUS_ROLE > smbusCfg->role ) && ( NULL != smbusCfg->udid ) )
        {
			FW_IF_CFG myLocalIf =
            {
				.upperFirewall  = SMBUS_UPPER_FIREWALL,
                .open           = &smbusOpen,
                .close          = &smbusClose,
                .write          = &smbusWrite,
                .read           = &smbusRead,
                .ioctrl         = &smbusIoctrl,
                .bindCallback   = &smbusBindCallback,
                .cfg            = ( void* )smbusCfg,
                .lowerFirewall  = SMBUS_LOWER_FIREWALL
			};

            memcpy( fwIf, &myLocalIf, sizeof( FW_IF_CFG ) );

            FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG *thisSmbusCfg = ( FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG* )fwIf->cfg;

            printf( "smbus_create for port %u\r\n", thisSmbusCfg->port );
		}
		else
		{
			status = FW_IF_ERRORS_INVALID_CFG;
		}
	}
	else
    {
		status = FW_IF_ERRORS_PARAMS;
	}

	return status;
}
```


## Opening / Closing an interface

Once created, the public methods of the FW_IF_CFG instance can be called without needing to know about the underlying functionality.

if( FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE == pIf->open( pIf ) ){    printf( "SMBus opened OK\r\n" );}else{    printf( "Error opening SMBus\r\n" );}

Within the **FW_IF_open** implementation, the function:

1. Checks if the driver is initialised.
2. Creates a target device on the SMBus with the address set to the **port** variable in the **FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG** structure (pointed to by the ***cfg** pointer in the **FW_IF_CFG** handle).

To close:

```
	if( FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE == pIf->close( pIf ) )
	{
		printf( "SMBus closed OK\r\n" );
	}
	else
	{
		printf( "Error closing SMBus\r\n" );
	}
```

Within the **FW_IF_open** implementation, the function:

1. Checks if the driver is initialised.
2. Destroys the target device on the SMBus that it created in the **FW_IF_open** function.


## Writing data from an interface

```
#define TEST_DATA_SIZE  ( 64 )

static uint8_t txData[ TEST_DATA_SIZE ] = { 0 };

...

	if( FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE == pIf->write( pIf, 0x56, txData, 32, FW_IF_TIMEOUT_NO_WAIT ) )
	{
		printf( "SMBus data written OK\r\n" );
	}
	else
	{
		printf( "Error writing from SMBus\r\n" );
	}
```

Within the **FW_IF_write** implementation, the function:

1. Checks if the driver is initialised.
2. If operating as a Controller:
   1. Uses the **size** parameter to determine which SMBus protocol command to use.
   2. Initiates an SMBus Controller command write command.
3. If operating as a Target:
   1. Loads the data and size into the **readCallback** that will be triggered if a remote Controller sends a read command to the interface.


## Reading data from an interface

```
#define TEST_DATA_SIZE  ( 64 )

static uint8_t  rxData[ TEST_DATA_SIZE ] = { 0 };
static uint32_t rxSize = TEST_DATA_SIZE;

...
	if( FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE == pIf->read( pIf, 0x57, rxData, &rxSize, 50 ) )
	{
		printf( "SMBus data read OK\r\n" );
	}
	else
	{
		printf( "Error reading from SMBus\r\n" );
	}
```

Within the **FW_IF_read** implementation, the function:

1. Checks if the driver is initialised.
2. If operating as a Controller:
   1. Uses the ***size** parameter to determine which SMBus protocol command to use.
   2. Initiates an SMBus Controller read command.
   3. Waits **timeoutMs** (in this example, 50ms) and then (if data has been received in that timeframe) loads the received data into the **data** parameter and the number of bytes read into the ***size** parameter.
3. If operating as a Target:
   1. Waits **timeoutMs** (in this example, 50ms) for **writeCallback** to be triggered (if a remote Controller sends a write command to the interface) and loads the data and size in it into the **data** and ***size** parameters.



If the user doesn't want to wait for the response and simply wants to trigger a read, they can call the **read()** function with the **timeoutMs** set to **FW_IF_TIMEOUT_NO_WAIT** and use the bound callback to trigger with new data (see later).


## IO Ctrl

```
	if( FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE == pIf->ioctrl( pIf, FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_SET_TARGET, NULL ) )
	{
		printf( "SMBus ioctrl OK\r\n" );
	}
	else
	{
		printf( "Error ioctrl SMBus\r\n" );
	}
```

Within the **FW_IF_write** implementation, the function:

1. Checks if the driver is initialised.
2. Checks if the **option** variable (in this case, **FW_IF_SMBUS_SET_TARGET**) is a valid option.
3. Handles it accordingly.

```
static uint32_t smbusIoctrl( void *fwIf, uint32_t option, void * value )
{
    uint32_t         status       = FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE;
    FW_IF_CFG       *thisIf       = ( FW_IF_CFG* )fwIf;
    FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG *thisSmbusCfg = ( FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG* )thisIf->cfg;

    switch( option )
    {
	case FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_SET_CONTROLLER:
		iIsController = FW_IF_TRUE;
		break;

	case FW_IF_SMBUS_IOCTRL_SET_TARGET:
		iIsController = FW_IF_FALSE;
		break;

	default:
		status = FW_IF_ERRORS_UNRECOGNISED_OPTION;
		break;
	}

	printf( "smbus_ioctrl for port %u (option %u)\r\n", thisSmbusCfg->port, option );

    return status;
}
```

For options requiring passing in additional variables or retrieving data, the parameter ***value** can be used.


## Callbacks and Binding

The user application must implement its own version of the **FW_IF_callback** function.

```
uint32_t myLocalFunc( uint16_t eventId, uint8_t * data, uint32_t size )
{
    uint32_t status = FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE;
    int      i      = 0;

    printf( "Callback called: %u\r\n", eventId );

    switch( eventId )
    {
	case FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_NEW_RX_DATA:

		printf( "New data arrived (%u bytes(s))\r\n", size, size );

		if( ( FW_IF_SMBUS_MAX_DATA >= size ) && ( NULL != data ) )
		{
			for( i = 0; i < size; i++ )
			{
				printf( "Data[%02d] : %02d\r\n", i, data[i] );
            }
		}
		else
		{
			printf( "Invalid size\r\n" );
			status = FW_IF_ERRORS_PARAMS;
		}
		break;

	case FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_TX_COMPLETE:

		printf( "Data successfully tx'd\r\n");
		break;

	case FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_ADDRESS_CHANGE:

		if( NULL != data )
		{
			printf( "Port ID changed to 0x%02X\r\n, *( uint32_t* )data );
        }
		else
		{
			status = FW_IF_ERRORS_PARAMS;
		}
		break;

	case FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_WARNING:

		/* Handle warning */
		break;

	case FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_ERROR:

		/* Handle error */
		break;

	default:
		break;
	}

	return status;
}
```

Then, the user application binds the callback into the FW_IF handle.

```
	if( FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE == pIf1->bindCallback( pIf1, &myLocalFunc ) )
	{
		printf( "SMBus callback bound OK\r\n" );
	}
	else
	{
		printf( "Error binding SMBus callback\r\n" );
	}
```

Within the **FW_IF_write** implementation, the function stores the function pointer as the **raiseEvent** variable in the **FW_IF_CFG** handle.

```
static uint32_t smbusBindCallback( void *fwIf, FW_IF_callback * newFunc )
{
    uint32_t   status = FW_IF_ERRORS_NONE;
    FW_IF_CFG *thisIf = ( FW_IF_CFG* )fwIf;

    if( NULL != newFunc )
    {
		FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG *thisSmbusCfg = ( FW_IF_SMBUS_CFG* )thisIf->cfg;
        thisIf->raiseEvent = newFunc;

        printf( "smbusBindCallback called for port %u\r\n", thisSmbusCfg->port );
	}
	else
	{
		status = FW_IF_ERRORS_PARAMS;
	}

	return status;
}
```

Now, at specific places in the implementation, the **raiseEvent()** can be called with any relevant data for the appropriate event.

```
/* E.g. in the callback trigger by an SMBus receiving data */
...
	if( NULL != thisIf->raiseEvent )
	{
		thisIf->raiseEvent( FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_NEW_RX_DATA, &dataBuffer, bufferSize );
	}

	...

	if( FW_IF_TRUE == thereIsAnError )
	{
		thisIf->raiseEvent( FW_IF_SMBUS_EVENT_ERROR, NULL, 0 );
	}

	...
```

Some local caching may be required if the **FW_IF_CFG** handle is not in context at the time of raising the event. As each handle is associated with a specific port/address, however, that should not be difficult.
